============================
collective.documentgenerator
============================

``collective.documentgenerator`` is an elegant product allowing to easily **produce office documents** based on dynamic templates.

New content types are used to store the different templates:

* **style templates**, that can be common for other templates
* **sub templates**, that can be used in other templates
* **mailing loop templates**, that can be used by other templates to do a loop for mailing
* **basic templates**
* **advanced templates**, regarding configuration

Templates are created within `LibreOffice <https://www.libreoffice.org>`_ software.

Output formats are those that can be produced by LibreOffice:

* odt and ods formats
* doc, docx, xls, xlsx formats
* pdf, csv, rtf

You can use a demo profile to easily test the product.

Usage
=====


**How to add a new POD template?**
----------------------------------

In your Plone site, you can add two sorts of main templates :

- PODTemplate : composed of title, description and odt file to be uploaded
- ConfigurablePODTemplate : adding configurable fields to basic template

  * output formats selection
  * portal types selection
  * style template selection
  * subtemplate selection
  * TAL expression as condition (`behavior <https://github.com/collective/collective.behavior.talcondition>`_).
  * enabling flag
  * context variables list
  * mailing loop template

If you want, you can organize your templates in one or more folder.


**How to write the template ?**
-------------------------------

The `appy framework <https://appyframe.work/tool/public>`_ is used to interpret the template and render it using the context.

You can find a `documentation <https://appyframe.work/13>`_ explaining the syntax that can be used.

You can do the following things:

- use basic python expression to access context fields or methods
- do an if... then... else...
- do a loop for a paragraph, a section, a table, a row, a cell
- transform xhtml to text

Base helper methods can be used in templates and custom methods can be added.


**How to generate a document?**
-------------------------------

A viewlet displays all the available PODTemplate and ConfigurablePODTemplate following the current context.
Clicking the template link will call the 'document-generation' view.

- Calling 'document-generation' view

  * render template and propose to download the generated document
  * parameters: template UID and document type
  * this is the default view used in the viewlet

- Calling 'persistent-document-generation' view

  * render template and create a file with the generated document
  * parameters: template UID and document type

- Calling 'mailing-loop-persistent-document-generation' view

  * loop on persisted rendered document and create a file containing all documents
  * parameters: document UID

**Search and replace**
----------------------

Documentation about the search and replace feature is here :
`docs/search_replace.rst <https://github.com/collective/collective.documentgenerator/tree/master/docs/search_replace.rst>`_


**Logging & Debugging**
-----------------------

You can specify form request that will be logged using collective.fingerpointing by defining environment variable
`DOCUMENTGENERATOR_LOG_PARAMETERS)` each parameter must be separated by a comma e.g. `param1,param2`


Plone versions
